# Ugly YouTube (Chrome Extension)

## My Life Story

I hate doom-scrolling and wasting my life soooo I made this little extension just for the sake of dumbing YouTube down some. As of now the functionality includes:

- No access for YouTube shorts
- No main `ytd-browse` element on the homepage (where they auto-suggest videos)

Still very much a work in progress but just trying to be less an addict day by day.
