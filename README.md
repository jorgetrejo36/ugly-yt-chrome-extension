# Ugly YouTube (Chrome Extension)

## My Life Story

I hate doom-scrolling and wasting my life so I made this little extension just for the sake of dumbing YouTube down some. As of now the functionality includes:

- No access for YouTube shorts
- No main `ytd-browse` element on the homepage (where they auto-suggest videos)

Still very much a work in progress but just trying to be less an addict day by day.

## How to use

1. Clone this repo
2. Go to your browser's extensions page (e.g., `chrome://extensions`, `edge://extensions`, `brave://extensions`, or `opera://extensions`)
3. Toggle developer mode on in the top right corner
4. Click `Load unpacked` in the top left area
5. Select the folder where you cloned the repo

After that if any new changes are pulled in or if you make your own local changes you should be able to just refresh them from your browser's extension page and be all good.
